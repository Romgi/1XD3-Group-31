            <p><strong>Consistency</strong> – Each page in the website is styled the same and has the same font and
                color scheme for its
                headers, footers, and navigation sections. Additionally, the layout of the web page stays consistent as
                you navigate the website with a clean tile-based system and different forms of easy navigation. Specific
                examples of this are its tile-based design used to show information and the use of a tabbed interface to
                store information. Both of these techniques are shown on all of the webpages.</p>
            <p><strong>Ease of Navigation</strong> – The tabs on the navbar stay consistent while navigating each page,
                making sure you
                don’t get lost while navigating. It is also easy to navigate to the page you want; no links are
                misplaced or too small, etc.</p>
            <p><strong>Universal Usability and Accessibility</strong> – Text is written very clearly, and there is an
                apparent color
                contrast between the background and the foreground. Additionally, the website is very responsive on all
                screens, using a dropdown menu for smaller screens and a navbar for larger screens. It also stacks its
                information on top of each other instead of shrinking down text.</p>
            <p><strong>Error Prevention</strong> – No errors appear on the main HTML. All errors are hidden in the
                console, and the page
                overall runs smoothly.</p>

            <div class="link-buttons">
                <a href="https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="link-button">
                    <img src="images/Berkshire-Hathaway-Logo.png" alt="Berkshire Hathaway" />

            <p><strong>Consistency</strong> – Nearly every single page on this website has a different layout, There is
                no consistent
                navigation bar or flow at all and the only way to get back to the home page is by going back to the
                original URL manually</p>
            <p><strong>Ease of Navigation</strong> – This site has no visual aids aside from the company logo. The site
                is simply a list
                of links with no way to navigate the site aside reading the entire link to determine where it will take
                you.</p>
            <p><strong>Universal Usability and Accessibility</strong> – The text size is too small for most users and
                the purple text on
                white background is very hard to read. The site has completely neglected any form of responsiveness, as
                the entire website shrinks to fit the horizontal dimension of your screen.</p>
            <p><strong>Error Prevention</strong> – Due to the simplicity of the site, there are no errors present.
                However, there also
                doesn't seem to be any error prevention because of this.</p>
