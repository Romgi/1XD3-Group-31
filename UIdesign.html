            <h1>Good Web Design: <a href="https://business.adobe.com/">Adobe Business</a></h1>
            <p>Consistency – Each page in the website is styled the same and has the same font and color scheme for its headers, footers, and navigation sections. Additionally, the layout of the web page stays consistent as you navigate the website with a clean tile-based system and different forms of easy navigation. Specific examples of this are its tile-based design used to show information and the use of a tabbed interface to store information. Both of these techniques are shown on all of the webpages.</p>
            <p>Ease of Navigation – The tabs on the navbar stay consistent while navigating each page, making sure you don’t get lost while navigating. It is also easy to navigate to the page you want; no links are misplaced or too small, etc.</p>
            <p>Universal Usability and Accessibility – Text is written very clearly, and there is an apparent color contrast between the background and the foreground. Additionally, the website is very responsive on all screens, using a dropdown menu for smaller screens and a navbar for larger screens. It also stacks its information on top of each other instead of shrinking down text.</p>
            <p>Error Prevention – No errors appear on the main HTML. All errors are hidden in the console, and the page overall runs smoothly.</p>
