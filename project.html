            <h1>Project Overview</h1>
            <p><strong>Project Name:</strong> McMaster Concert Band Website & Music Library</p>
            <p><strong>Client:</strong> McMaster Concert Band</p>
            <p>
                The McMaster Concert Band is a mixed ensemble of approximately 70 members. The goal of this project
                is to design and develop a modern, McMaster-branded website that serves both as a public-facing
                information hub and an internal platform for music distribution and band resources.
